# hash-to-curve-sage
Sage test implementations of indifferentiable hashing to elliptic curves

This is a reference implementation, implementing the functionality described in
the [Hashing to Elliptic
Curves](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/)
standards documentation.

The implementation is a reference implementation and is not suitable for use in
production software.
